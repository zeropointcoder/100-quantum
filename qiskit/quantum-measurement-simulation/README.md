# Quantum Measurement Simulation using Qiskit

This project simulates **quantum measurement** using **Qiskit**, IBM's quantum computing SDK for Python.

In quantum mechanics, measurement collapses a quantum state into one of its basis states.  

This simulation shows how a qubit in **superposition** collapses probabilistically to either `|0⟩` or `|1⟩`.

## Steps
1. Creating a quantum circuit with a qubit in superposition.
2. Simulating quantum measurement using Qiskit AerSimulator.
3. Visualising the measurement results as a histogram.

## Requirements
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
```bash
python3 quantum_measurement_simulation.py
```
