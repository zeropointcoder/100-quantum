# Quantum Stats Analyser

To simulate quantum circuits and analyse the resulting measurement statistics.

## Overview
- Create a 2-qubit quantum circuit.
- Simulate the circuit.
- Perform measurements on the qubits.
- Display the measurement counts and calculate probabilities.
- Plot a histogram of the results.

## Requirements
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
```bash
python3 quantum_stats_analyser.py
```
