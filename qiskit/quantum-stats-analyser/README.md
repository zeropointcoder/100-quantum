# Quantum Stats Analyser

To simulate quantum circuits and analyse the resulting measurement statistics.

This project is an example of how to perform quantum measurements, visualise statistics, and understand quantum behaviour in a simulated environment.

## Steps
- Create a 2-qubit quantum circuit.
- Simulate the circuit.
- Perform measurements on the qubits.
- Display the measurement counts and calculate probabilities.
- Plot a histogram of the results.

## Requirements
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
```bash
python3 quantum_stats_analyser.py
```
