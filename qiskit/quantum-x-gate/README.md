# Quantum NOT Gate (X-Gate)

## Goal
This project demonstrates how to implement and simulate a **Quantum NOT Gate (Pauli-X gate)** using **Qiskit**.

## Overview
The **X gate** flips the state of a qubit:

- |0⟩ → |1⟩  
- |1⟩ → |0⟩  

It is the quantum equivalent of a classical NOT operation.

## Requirements
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
```bash
python3 quantum_x_gate.py
```
