# Shor’s Algorithm for integer factorisation

Shor’s Algorithm is a quantum algorithm for integer factorisation that provides an exponential speedup over classical algorithms.

Here, we’ll use Qiskit’s built-in simulation of Shor’s algorithm to factor small integers such as 15, since simulating large quantum circuits is computationally expensive.

## Goal
Implement Shor’s algorithm to factor small integers such as 15.

## Steps

 
## Requirements
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
```bash
python3 shor_factorisation.py
```
