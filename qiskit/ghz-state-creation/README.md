# Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) State Creation

## Goal
This project demonstrates the creation of a GHZ state


## Overview

A GHZ state involves multiple qubits that are entangled in a specific way. The most common form is a 3-qubit GHZ state, which is represented as:

$$
|GHZ\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|000\rangle + |111\rangle)
$$

## Requirements
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
```bash
python3 ghz_state_creation.py
```
