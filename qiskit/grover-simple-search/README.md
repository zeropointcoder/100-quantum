# Grover’s Algorithm – Simple Search (2–3 Qubits)

This project demonstrates Grover’s search algorithm implemented using **Qiskit**, for 2-qubit and 3-qubit systems.  

It marks a specific target state (e.g. |11⟩ or |101⟩) and amplifies its probability using Grover’s quantum amplitude amplification.
